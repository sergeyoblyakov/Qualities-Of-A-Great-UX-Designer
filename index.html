<p>However, it takes more than just creativity to make a great <a href="https://www.ramotion.com/agency/ui-ux-design/">UX designer</a>. Yes, creativity is going to be part of it, but it takes more to be great at creating a user experience design that is smart and extremely useful. UX design touches on the behavior of users. It should be responsive to what the user needs. That obviously needs more than just creativity. Right? Going to the bottom of this context is very important. That is why you are advised to read this entire article which will give you a sort of enlightenment.</p>
<p>Let’s start!</p>
<h3>What the UX designer actually does?</h3>
<p>The UX designer designs the part of the website that makes interaction between user and computer easy. It makes the user experience top-notch, hence, the name. Of course, it is only when the user is satisfied with the use of the website that we can actually say that the UX design was done well. When the UX design is great, more people will visit the website. As a result, more income would actually reach the company. An amazing website can bring in more business. </p>
<p>A <a href="https://medium.com/theymakedesign/ui-ux-design-agency-b0e313a78ade">UI/UX designer</a> is one of the key people that could create a great website. The UI refers to the user interface, which is basically how the website physically looks. Again, this is more than just creativity. The physical layout has to be attractive, of course, but there should also be other factors like how easy it is for users to understand the website. </p>
<p>So, what makes a great UX designer? A great question you have to understand.</p>
<h3>He has to show versatility on his own craft.</h3>
<p>The most basic web need of a startup is the website. But not for long. There comes a time when the website won’t serve the business fully anymore. You have to maximize the ways of serving the clients, which are also ways in attracting clients. After creating a great website, it’s about time to expand the website’s capability through the web application. The latter is a separate entity but is accessed through the website. It has different components, which mean that it has to be created by a software engineer. </p>
<p>The UX designer plays a large role in creating a web app. The role of the UX designer is to make sure that users find it easy to navigate the website while also transitioning to the app. They need to have the same level of smartness and responsiveness. You can’t have a great website with a terrible web app. It’s in the latter where you can immediately make money. You can’t also have a great web app with a terrible website because the website is the gateway for online shopping, which is in the web app. </p>
<p>Then, if business is truly getting better, it’s time to create a mobile app. Again, the role of the UX designer is to make sure that the mobile app is so much easier for the user to navigate. The mobile app is the user’s direct link to the business. It’s where they can do their shopping without having to pass various steps like going through a website.</p>
<h3>He must possess analytical skills.</h3>
<p>UX designers are actually problem solvers. One problem that they continuously try to solve is how to make the website better in terms of user experience. You have to remember that technology is always being innovated. There is always a new trend out there. The company has to keep up with these things and it is the responsibility of the UX designer to make the website or web application be smarter, and more responsive. Any innovation should not affect the maneuverability of a website or application.</p>
<p>There is also that problem—okay, maybe it can’t really be considered a problem—of conversion. Every company wants to earn more. In order to do that, they should be able to understand what the company stands for. This leads us to the next quality:p>
<h3>He should be able to understand and imagine things.</h3>
<p>The designer should understand what the company needs and what the prospective audience wants. Let’s start with the company. The designer should understand what the company is aiming for—and we’re not talking about the obvious here. All businesses want to earn, but there is also a bigger purpose to have a business. For example, as the world is currently experiencing the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-54146908" rel="nofollow">coronavirus pandemic</a>, many businesses have started a delivery service. Some businesses also purposely launched a delivery service. </p>
<p>Now, new businesses and new developments in business were fueled by the need for it. With people ordered to stay at home. While it is easy to see that these companies were merely taking advantage of the situation, it is also possible that these businesses truly want to help. Perhaps, the entrepreneurs behind the delivery services also experienced the difficulty in getting essentials during the pandemic and thought they could hit two birds with one stone by opening the delivery service. </p>
<p>But we’ve digressed from the topic. The UX designer should have that understanding on what truly drives the business forward. If it’s just the money, then the business will not improve. It has to be more than that. There should be a deeper meaning to it that the designer can address in the user experience perspective of the website or web application and even mobile application. UX designing goes beyond the idea of just making money. That is why it is somehow related to the idea of branding. Well, brands need UX designs for them to excel. This is the main point why you’re advised to look for a great UX designer today.</p>
<h3>Of course, he must be willing to learn!</h3>
<p>There is so much to learn in technology, especially since it is ever changing. A great UX designer is willing to learn all the time. It doesn’t mean that since they have been hired by large companies, they have already reached the peak of their expertise. There is always something new to learn, especially with technology. Remember that there was a time when businesses only needed a website. This has evolved greatly since then. </p>
<p>The pandemic is also a wakeup call to a lot of businesses. So many have closed during the pandemic because for one, they were ordered closed by the government. Then a lot of them had to permanently close because they couldn’t survive the closure. </p>
<p>However, businesses with web apps where customers can order online survived. Just because the government ordered them closed didn’t mean there was no business to be had. That was particularly true for businesses selling essentials like food, household items and other important everyday products. </p>
<p>There is also something new to learn every day and a UX designer has to be open to that. Like any other profession, learning is always a continuous process. It must not stop. Those people who think they already have the absolute knowledge can lose in the end. There is no finity when it comes to learning. </p>
<p>After all the facts are given here, do you think the role of a UX designer is very important for businesses nowadays? It’s your turn to answer based on what you’ve understood from this article.</p>
